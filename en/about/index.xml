      <description>#What is coost coost is an elegant and efficient cross-platform C++ base library. Its goal is to create a sword of C++ to make C++ programming easy and enjoyable.
Coost, co for short, is like boost, but more lightweight, the static library built on linux or mac is only about 1MB in size. However, it still provides enough powerful features:
Command line and config file parser (flag) High performance log library (log) Unit testing framework Benchmark testing framework go-style coroutine Coroutine-based network library JSON RPC framework Atomic operation (atomic) Efficient stream (fastream) Efficient string (fastring) String utility (str) Time library (time) Thread library (thread) Timed Task Scheduler God-oriented programming Efficient JSON library Hash library Path library File utilities (fs) System operations (os) Fast memory allocator #History of coost 2013-2015, Alvin(idealvin) felt a little cumbersome when using google&amp;rsquo;s gflags, glog, gtest, etc.</description>
