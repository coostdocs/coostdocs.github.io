      <title>Byte order</title>

Data in the computer is stored in bytes (8 bit). Big-endian computers use big-endian byte order, that is, the high-order byte is at the lower address, and the low-order byte is at the higher address. The little-endian machine uses little-endian byte order, that is, the low-order byte is at the lower address, and the high-order byte is at the higher address.
A single byte is exactly the same on big endian and little endian machines, while the basic data types of multiple bytes have are different.</description>

      <description>include: co/so/tcp.h.
#tcp::Connection tcp::Connection is a simple encapsulation of TCP connection, it is designed for TCP server. When SSL is enabled in a TCP server, tcp::Connection will transfer data by SSL.
#Connection::Connection Connection(int sock); Connection(void* ssl); Connection(Connection&amp;amp;&amp;amp; c);  The constructor, Connection is created by tcp::Server, users do not need to create it manually. The first version constructs a normal TCP connection, the second version constructs a TCP connection that support SSL, and the third is a move constructor.</description>

      <description>include: co/so/http.h.
#http::Client http::Client is a coroutine-based http client, which is implemented based on libcurl.
#Client::Client explicit Client(const char* serv_url);  Constructor, the parameter serv_url is the url address of the server, and its form is protocol://host:port, the following server urls are all ok:  &amp;ldquo;github.com&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;https://github.com&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;http://127.0.0.1:7788&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;http://[::1]:8888&amp;rdquo;   Like the tcp::Client, connection is not established in the constructor.  #Client::~Client Client::~Client();  Destructor, close the connection, and release libcurl related resources.</description>

      <title>RPC</title>

      <guid>https://cocoyaxi.github.io/en/co/net/rpc/</guid>
      <description>include: co/so/rpc.h.
co/rpc is a high-performance RPC framework similar to grpc, it uses JSON as the data exchange format, which is different from binary protocols such as protobuf.
#rpc::Service class Service { public: Service() = default; virtual ~Service() = default; typedef std::function&amp;lt;void(Json&amp;amp;, Json&amp;amp;)&amp;gt; Fun; virtual const char* name() const = 0; virtual const co::map&amp;lt;const char*, Fun&amp;gt;&amp;amp; methods() const = 0; };  This class is a pure interface, which represents a service.</description>
